# Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands. A group of connected trues forms an island. For example, the below matrix contains 5 islands.

# Input : mat = [[T, T, F, F, F],
#                [F, T, F, F, T],
#                [T, F, F, T, T],
#                [F, F, F, F, F],
#                [T, F, T, F, T]]
# Output : 5


def num_islands(grid)

end 

# for every idx, you need to check its horizontal, vertical, and diagonal surroundings. If they are all F, then there is an island.
