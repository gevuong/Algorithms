## Techniques to Tackle Array or Linked List Problems
1. Two Pointer Technique
  - One slow-runner and one fast-runner.
  - One pointer starts at the beginning, and other pointer starts at the end
  - Pointer move towards each other until they meet.

- Examples implementing the Two Pointer Technique
  - Remove duplicates from sorted array


## Algorithms
1. In-place
  - Prevents allocation of extra space for another array. Results in O(1) extra memory.
